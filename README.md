## What we want it to do?
1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket.
    - The ticket fees are going to go to the winner during the draw.
2. After X period of time, the lottery will automatically draw a winner.
    - And this will be done programatically.
3. Using Chainlink VRF & Chainlink Automation to generate randomness and have time-based triggers.
